Amos Wenger's ooc bindings for Steve Dekorte's libcoroutine

libcoroutine provides a portable, stackfull implementation of coroutines in C99, using
mostly fibers, ucontext, etc. depending on the platform/compile options.

Instructions
============

You must checkout Steve Dekorte's coroutine in the same directory as ooc-coroutine
in order to use it (check it out on github)
Then add it to your sourcepath, e.g. compile with

ooc -sourcepath=.:../ooc-coroutine/ myTest.ooc

(if your project's folder is in the same folder as ooc-coroutine)
